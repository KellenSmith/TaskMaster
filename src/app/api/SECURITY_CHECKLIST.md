# Payment Callback Route Security Checklist (Vercel Deployment)

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

1. **IP Whitelisting**: Restricted access to Swedbank Pay IP addresses
2. **Enhanced IP Detection**: Uses multiple headers (x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip, cf-connecting-ip)
3. **Input Validation**: Validates payload structure and required fields
4. **Enhanced Security Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring
5. **Error Handling**: Generic error responses to prevent information disclosure
6. **Order Status Protection**: Prevents updating completed orders

## üîß Vercel Built-in Security (No Action Needed)

- **Request Size Limits**: Vercel automatically limits request body size (4.5MB for Hobby, 4.5MB for Pro)
- **Content-Type Validation**: Next.js automatically validates JSON content-type
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Vercel automatically enforces HTTPS in production
- **DDoS Protection**: Vercel provides automatic DDoS protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Vercel has built-in rate limiting (varies by plan)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Issues to Address

### 1. **Missing Webhook Signature Verification** (HIGH PRIORITY)

- **Issue**: No cryptographic verification of webhook authenticity
- **Risk**: Attackers could forge payment notifications
- **Solution**: Implement signature verification using Swedbank Pay's webhook secret
- **Status**: TODO comments added in code

### 2. **Environment Variables Security**

Add these environment variables to your Vercel project:

```env
SWEDBANK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:

    - [ ] Contact Swedbank Pay to get webhook signature details
    - [ ] Implement signature verification (uncomment and complete TODO sections)
    - [ ] Add `SWEDBANK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable to Vercel
    - [ ] Test webhook signature verification with test payments

2. **Long-term Considerations**:
    - [ ] Regular security audits
    - [ ] IP allowlist updates when Swedbank Pay changes their infrastructure
    - [ ] Consider implementing idempotency keys to prevent duplicate processing
    - [ ] Set up monitoring alerts for failed payment callbacks

## üìù Security Best Practices Applied

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only accepting requests from known IPs
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers (IP + signature verification)
- **Fail Secure**: Denying access by default
- **Security Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail
- **Leverage Platform Security**: Using Vercel's built-in protections

## üö® Monitoring & Alerts

Monitor these events in Vercel logs:

- Unauthorized IP access attempts
- Invalid webhook signatures (once implemented)
- Failed order updates
- Processing time anomalies

## üìû Incident Response

If you detect suspicious activity:

1. Review Vercel function logs
2. Check Swedbank Pay's status page
3. Verify IP allowlist is current
4. Contact Swedbank Pay if needed
