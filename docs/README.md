# TaskMaster Documentation

Welcome! This docs folder collects the essentials to run, develop, and understand TaskMaster.

- 00-purpose: Why TaskMaster exists, who it serves, and the principles.
- 01-getting-started: Install, run, and common tasks.
- 02-environment: Required environment variables with purpose and sample `.env.example`.
- 03-architecture: High-level overview of the app (Next.js App Router, Prisma, Auth, Payments, Uploads).
- 04-testing: How we run tests locally and in CI, plus useful patterns.
- 05-user-scenarios: Real problems TaskMaster solves for different types of organizations.

Contributions: keep docs concise and practical. Prefer examples over long prose. If behavior changes, update docs in the same PR.
